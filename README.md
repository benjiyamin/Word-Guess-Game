# Aurora: A Word-Guessing Game

Aurora is based on the classic game "hangman", where you take your best shot at guessing a selected word within a certain number of guesses. Instead of playing with a friend, a pencil, and paper the game randomly selects a space-themed word and you use your computer's keyboard to make your guesses.

Good luck!
